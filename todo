# to do

## architecture

- [ ] decoupled errors
  - name resolution, type checking, etc. should not involve pretty printing
  - types are allocated in an arena; the error reporting infrastructure must
    be able to understand references inside there
- [ ] non-leaking names
  - names are interned in an arena: this will just keep growing forever and
    ever (which is very bad).
  - it's probably fine for now to just keep names as `&'src str`s (identifiers
    are usually quite small)
  - if it's bad, a less temporary solution is maybe `(&'src str, hash)`, where
    the hash is used to discard comparisons
- [ ] figure out the caching/quering/salsaing/incrementalling situation
- [ ] ... and asyncify everything (i.e. make things cancellable)

## design

- [ ] syntax for anonymous sums/polymorphic variants
- [ ] labels for record types; nominal records
- [ ] module type system

## language

- [ ] report the type of expression holes
- [ ] translate the inferred program to one without unification vars

## continuous goals

- rid the dependency list!
  - see "non-leaking names" for `internment`
  - maybe some simple homegrown stuff for `malachite`
  - rethink the command line and hence get rid of `argh` (radical)
  - what's up with `dashmap`
  - move to `async-lsp`?
- tinify the binary size
  - below a megabyte on release builds is the dream
